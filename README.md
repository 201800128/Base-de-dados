# What is this? 
This is a repository with  project developed in the curricular unit "Base de Dados" of my bioinformatics degree.
We were asked to create a database to help manage the application process for an institution higher education. 
For that, we used the Microsoft tool "SQL Management Studio" that uses a language of structured query or SQL.

# What I learned?
With this project, I acquired some basic knowledge about this language "SQL" and the Microsoft tool "SQL Management Studio".
I hope it can be useful in the near future.
